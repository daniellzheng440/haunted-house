						<td>1800s</td>
						<td class="left">Now used as a lavish location for the popular steakhouse chain, the mansion on Jarvis Street was once the home of Hart Massey and his family in the late 1800s. Rumour has it, the women’s washroom on the second floor is haunted. In between steak and dessert, you can walk around the restaurant and to see if you can spot a ghost in the mansion’s great entrance.</td>

						<td>1913</td>
						<td class="left">The Elgin and Winter Garden Theatre is another theatre that is allegedly haunted. After opening in 1913, it was home to vaudeville acts, and many believe the ghosts of the property are of that era. Some have reported strange things happening in the balconies of the theatre, as well as chairs folding and unfolding on their own. Spooky.</td>

						<td><article><h3>Massey Hall</h3></article></td>
						<td>1900s</td>
						<td class="left">Located just minutes away from Yonge-Dundas Square, Massey Hall has hosted concerts for more than 100 years. There are reports of a few ghosts calling Massey Hall home. Both Toronto.com and Torontoghosts.org report that a ghost of an old man dressed in “old-timey” clothes sometimes makes an appearance backstage.</td>
